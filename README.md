# Personal Portfolio
### A project from Codecademy
This is a personal portfolio project from Codecademy. It is a simple website that showcases my work and provides a way for people to contact me. It is built using HTML and CSS. (and a bit of JS)

## Access it [here](https://erngusmik.github.io/personal-portfolio/).

#### Deploying the website locally
If you want to make things complicated and deploy the website locally, just download this repository and open the index.html file in your browser. (Or use the Live Server extension for VSCode: just click 'Go Live')
